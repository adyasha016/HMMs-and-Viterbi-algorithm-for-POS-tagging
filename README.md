# HMMs-and-Viterbi-algorithm-for-POS-tagging

In this assignment, the Viterbi algorithm is modified to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. Before modifying the Viterbi algorithm, we first use the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 

Next we make use of techniques - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc . to modify the Viterbi algorithm .

Finally we need to compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
